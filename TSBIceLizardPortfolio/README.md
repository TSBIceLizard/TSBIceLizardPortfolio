## Readme for the Week-01 assignment (Using HTML and CSS to assemble a basic website)

## Using GitHub

### Push to Github

First command
git add .

Second command
git commit -m "Chore/feat: Some information about the commit"

third command
git push

### Cloning and Pulliing FROM Github

The first time one is technically setting up their github workspace by pulling the files FROM github, you must first clone the repo. For security reasons this is best done with SSH.

#### First, when looking at the repo - Click the green <> Code button situated above and to the right of the repo folder structure.

#### Afterwards, select the SSH tab.

#### Copy the link (this will work if your SSH key pair is added to your github account)

Afterwards, go to your terminal.
And then:
git clone PASTEDSSHURL

A SSH url often starts with git@github.com:followed by the repo owners username.

#### If you already have the repo's cloned working directory but are on a more outdated version

Making sure you are navigated to the correct directory, in your terminal:
git pull

The integrity of the synchronicity MUST be ensured, otherwise it may result in you having to do extra measures to fix your repo if you push out of sync changes!!!!

## Some things I struggled with

I couldn't quite remember how to center items on the page in some cases. It seems that text is easy with text-align:center; but images and other elements are a different kettle of fish.

## Purpose of the website

The website's purpose was just to create a really basic portfolio template. If I was able to spend more time on it I could do alot more but right now am just trying to meet the assignment criteria instead of burning out!
