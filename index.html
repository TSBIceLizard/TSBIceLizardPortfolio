          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <article class="aboutmeformatting">
            <p>Yo,</p>
            <p>
              I'm Arron Burgess, a generalist 3d modeller, environment designer,
              prop modeller, PBR material artist/texture artist, software
              development student, gamer and appreciator of the natural world.
            </p>

            <p>
              My experience in level design initially stems from creating third
              party maps for the first Unreal (also re-released as Unreal Gold)
              back in 2002 or 2003, to Half-Life, to Quake 2, to Half-Life 2, to
              GZDoom, to idTech 4.5 (the engine that runs Doom 3 BFG Edition),
              so on and so forth. Creating game worlds is a strong passion of
              mine, to which as a subject there are many facets of.
            </p>

            <p>
              3d Modelling is not dissimilar from creating 3d world geometry for
              most of these older titles. Typically most of these engine's rely
              on world geometry format known as BSP (binary space partitioning),
              but what 3d modelling and level design have in common is that they
              all consist of vertexes, edges and polygons - and anyone creating
              experiences with these needs to be conscious of their budget
              (mostly polygons) on screen at one time. Newer engines certainly
              make use of new hardware features found in newer GPU's, supporting
              a higher polygon budget. Older engines such as Unreal Engine 1
              that powers Unreal currently only renders everything from the CPU,
              as the game was developed before graphics cards were a standard
              for gaming, therfore one has to be more artificially stringent
              with their polygon and performance budget.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started dablling with 3d modelling for my Unreal 1 levels back
              in 2013, at first creating simple static meshes and props like
              intricate fluorescent light fixtures. Perhaps around the same time
              I started using GIMP to create new textures. At first my textures
              were either basic edits of pre-existing Unreal textures or edits
              of photo sources.
            </p>

            <p>
              When discovering highpoly to lowpoly baking workflows akin to id
              Software's method of creating all of the models and materials in
              Doom 3 (actually it's a method that's quite standard practice in
              the common day), I feel as though my ability to create things
              without restraints really exploded. This method opens the door to
              PBR materials among so much more and I feel I can create anything
              I really want to.
            </p>

            <p>
              My love for gaming spans all the way from my early years. At the
              age of 3 in 1993 I was playing on my Dad's Atari ST and Spectrum,
              afterwards I would be playing various games on the Sega Megadrive
              after it was handed down to me from my older cousin. I moved onto
              PC gaming also around the same time I started getting into the
              Playstation. My very first games on the PC included Quake, Hexen,
              Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, Populous, Dungeon Keeper and
              potentially more.
            </p>

            <p>
              My 3d art is complimented by my love of the natural world and
              historical castles (which we have alot of here in the UK).

              My tools of the trade include programs such as Blender, Unreal
              Editor, Substance 3d Painter, GIMP, TrenchBroom, Substance
              Designer and Hammer.

                Unreal Editor is a CSG and BSP level creation tool that is
                supplied with the first game in the franchise, known simply as
                Unreal. The first two games, Unreal and Unreal Tournament were
                made freely available via OldUnreal (<a
                  href="https://www.oldunreal.com"
                  >The OldUnreal Site</a
                >) due to express permission from Epic Games. Both games come
                included with their latest community updates, including
                UnrealEditor 2.2.

                Blender is a free, versatile powerhouse of many trades and can
                be used for alot of things, but it's main purpose is for 3d
                modelling and animation. Blender can be obtained from it's
                foundation's website
                <a href="https://www.blender.org/">here</a>.

                Substance 3d Painter is now unfortunately owned by Adobe, but I
                think perpetual licenses still exist for purchase on Steam!

                GIMP stands for GNU Image Manipulation program and is a free
                equivilent to Photoshop. This program is good for loading and
                modifying different image formats. Gimp is housed

                TrenchBroom is a popular editor in the idtech engine space and
                Quake community. There are a couple of forks available,
                including one for RBDoom3-BFG. The standalone tool can be found
                <a href="https://trenchbroom.github.io/">here</a>!

              <p>
                Hammer is the level editor for Valve's Half-Life. It's also used
                for Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike, Half-Life:
                Alyx and a few more. If you obtain any of those games on Steam
                you will be able to acquire the tool for free through Steam!
